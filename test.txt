this was made in vim!

dump all changes into commit:

git add -A

git pull over changes:
git reset --hard		#deletes all changes since last pull
git stash 			#creates a parallel file holding the changes and matches working directory with master



LESS commands
"/<text>" search for strings containing <text>
"N"/"n" find next or previous search result containing <text>
